# CareerPath Analytics
I started working on this project when I was taking my Information Visualization class. It was the end of spring semester and  i knew iwanted a summer internship that had something to do with bi development and data analytics. While  I had experience interning with SLK in tthe same domain, i wanted to practice and showcase more of my skillcet in that area. Since i was already job hunting, this inspired me to use this same use case to come up with real-world insifht needs and generate data driven solutions for the same. this is how careerPath was developed. It is an interactive report made on power bi.  I extracted data from the O*Net database (https://www.onetcenter.org/database.html) to create my own dataset. I employed R-based ETL techniques to normalize and structure the extracted data into a relational schema. Utilizing advanced R functionalities—including the dplyr package for data manipulation, lubridate for handling dates, and custom functions for data type conversions—I effectively prepared the data for analysis. Along with SQL to normalize and structure the extracted  data into a relational schema. I cleansed, deduplicated, and transformed the raw data while enforcing referential integrity and optimizing performance through indexing and partitioning for seamless Power BI integration.

This project was built on Power BI Desktop, to view the dashboards, please download the files.
