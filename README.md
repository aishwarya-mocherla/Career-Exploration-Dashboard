# CareerPath Analytics
CareerPath is an interactive Power BI report designed to provide data-driven career insights, leveraging information from the O*Net database. This project was inspired driven by my goal of refining my BI and data analytics skills while job hunting for a summer internship.

To develop CareerPath, I extracted and transformed O*Net data using R-based ETL techniques, structuring it into a relational schema. I employed advanced R functionalities, including dplyr for data manipulation, lubridate for date handling, and custom functions for data type conversions, ensuring a clean and efficient dataset. The final interactive dashboard delivers real-world insights tailored to career decision-making, showcasing my expertise in business intelligence, data engineering, and visualization through geographical, topical, categorical, and temporal analysis.

This project was built on Power BI Desktop, to view the dashboards, please download the files.
